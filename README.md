# Mini-SHRDLU Game Solver

This project is an implementation of the Mini-SHRDLU game, a computer game inspired by the SHRDLU program created in the late 1960s at MIT AI Laboratory. The goal of this project was to design a computer program that can automatically generate a solution to the Mini-SHRDLU game with any board size, n, and number of blocks, k, within certain constraints.

## Overview

The program allows users to interact with a Mini-SHRDLU game, where the goal is to move numbered blocks within an n * n vertically suspended board. The blocks must be placed in columns, next to each other down to the bottom in each column. The program generates an initial state of the board randomly and provides functionalities to execute legal actions, find a sequence of actions to reach a goal state, and display the game board state.

## Usage

To use the program:

1. Compile the source code using an appropriate compiler for C++.
2. Run the executable or program file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Mini-SHRDLU game.

## Other

- Features an A* search feature.
- Final Grade: 100/100
